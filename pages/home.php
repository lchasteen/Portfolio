  <h2>Software Development</h2>
  <p>I work in Athens, Georgia, and I enjoy designing, programming, creating  web applications, user interfaces, databases, and web sites.		  
  As a Developer, I solve problems for the customer. My desire is to help those in need and to work diligently to produce a quality product that is designed to last.
  If we do not enjoy what we do then why do it? My work is an artistic endevor. Coding creative solutions to complicated problems can be as rewarding as painting a beautiful work of art with brush on canvas.</p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
   <p>I am not new to programming; I started coding 15 years ago as a hobby.  
  A lot of the work that I do now is centered around web and software component development.
  Take some time to look at my portfolio and see some of the work that I have done.  Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
